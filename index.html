<h1>Spacetime</h1>
<p>Spacetime is a programming environment for interactive 2D graphics that runs in the browser. Programs are a grid of cells with time as the <code>x</code> dimension.</p>
<p>My goal is for Spacetime to be a platform for anyone to make games, interactive art, <a href="http://explorableexplanations.com/">explorable explanations</a>, and other programs. (There's a long way to go before that happens.) It's being designed to promote sharing and <a href="http://hapgood.us/2015/03/26/paper-thoughts-and-the-remix-hypothesis/">building off of</a> each other's work by making programs composable and copy/paste friendly.</p>

<p>Try out Spacetime <a href="https://www.spacetime.me/b3/new">here</a>. The demo mentions most of the keyboard shortcuts except that "d" deletes a row and "D" deletes a column. Another graphics command is "rotate".</p>

<h2>Pancakes (older version)</h2>
<p>This older version is actually more complete than Spacetime, but the ideas aren't as powerful. Still, a lot of what I did here I'd like to port over to Spacetime.</p>
