<h1>Future Programming Workshop 2015</h1>
<p><a href="../">&lt; home</a></p>
<p>I demoed two versions of my side project at the <a href="http://www.future-programming.org/">Future Programming Workshop</a> in October. They are...</p>

<h2>Spacetime (new version)</h2>
<p>Spacetime is a programming environment for interactive 2D graphics that runs in the browser. Programs are a grid of cells with time as the <code>x</code> dimension.</p>

<p>My goal is for Spacetime to be a platform for anyone to make games, interactive art, <a href="http://explorableexplanations.com/">explorable explanations</a>, and other programs. (There's a long way to go before that happens.) It's being designed to promote sharing and <a href="http://hapgood.us/2015/03/26/paper-thoughts-and-the-remix-hypothesis/">building off of</a> each other's work by making programs composable and copy/paste friendly.</p>
<p>Try out Spacetime <a href="https://www.spacetime.me/b13/new">here</a>. The demo mentions most of the keyboard shortcuts except that "d" deletes a row and "D" deletes a column. Another graphics command is "rotate".</p>

<h2>Interested?</h2>
<p>Follow the development of Spacetime on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/spacetime-talk">Google group</a>, or follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/jakesandlund">Twitter</a>. See the source and submit issues or pull requests on <a href="https://github.com/spacetimecode/spacetime">Github</a>.</p>

<h2>Pancakes (older version)</h2>
<p>This older version is actually more complete than Spacetime, but the ideas aren't as powerful. Still, a lot of what I did here I'd like to port over to Spacetime.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>I'd like to thank Jonathan Edwards and Richard Gabriel for organizing the workshop, all the participants for their helpful feedback, and my brother for early feedback from before I submitted to the conference.</p>
