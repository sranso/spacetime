# Spacetime

Spacetime is a programming environment for 2D graphics with a different approach to time. Programs are a two dimensional grid of cells with time as the x dimension. See [spacetimeup.com](https://spacetimeup.com) for an introduction and demo.

## Try it out

* On the web: Go to [spacetimeup.com/b13/new](https://spacetimeup.com/b13/new) to try Spacetime. The usage is on the [home page](https://spacetimeup.com) (demo and text).
* Locally:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/spacetimeup/spacetime.git
$ cd spacetime
$ open new.html
```

## Development

Spacetime is extremely early stage software. It's currently in the "research" phase, which means that the goal is to explore ideas and not to make a polished product. Essential functionality will be missing, and I may throw all the code away and start over (as I've done twice already).

If you are interested in Spacetime, there's a [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/spacetimeup) where we'll discuss the direction of the project, upcoming releases, and any other feedback you have. If you're interested in contributing, let me know there.
