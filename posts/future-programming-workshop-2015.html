<h1>Future Programming Workshop 2015</h1>
<p><a href="../">&lt; home</a></p>
<p>I participated in the <a href="http://www.future-programming.org/">future programming workshop</a> in October. I highly recommend it for anyone thinking about it next year. I demoed two versions of my side project, which is an end-user programming environment.</p>

<h2>Spacetime (new version)</h2>

<p>You can try out Spacetime <a href="../new">here</a>. The demo mentions most of the keyboard shortcuts, but I didn't say that "d" deletes a row and "D" deletes a column.</p>
<p>My original motivation for this project was to explore what programming could look like beyond editing text in a file, but I'm now thinking it would be cool to make games, interactive art, and <a href="http://explorableexplanations.com/">explorable explanations</a>. A requirement is that it must be simple enough for ordinary people to learn. I'd also like to focus on making things easy to <a href="http://hapgood.us/2015/03/26/paper-thoughts-and-the-remix-hypothesis/">remix</a> in powerful ways.</p>

<h2>Pancakes (original submission)</h2>
<p>This older version is actually more complete than Spacetime, but the ideas aren't as powerful. Still, a lot of what I did here I'd like to port over to Spacetime.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>I'd like to thank Jonathan Edwards and Richard Gabriel for organizing the workshop, all the participants for their helpful feedback, and my brother for early feedback from before I submitted to the conference.</p>
